    <h1>Hello, my name is Patrick ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>I'm a guy with a love for computers. I mostly do backend-type stuff using Python, but sometimes I try to branch into other languages, such as JavaScript or TypeScript. I also have <i>some</i> experience in C, Java, Lua, and of course JavaScript and Typescript.</p>
    <p>I also have experience with running Linux systems. A few of my projects are self-hosted in my basement.</p>
    <p>You can see all of my little projects on <a href="https://github.com/am2i9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my Github</a>.</p>
